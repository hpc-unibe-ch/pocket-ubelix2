## Overview

This repository delivers measures to setup a puppet development environment locally on a laptop.

## Description

By default the environment can setup a number of maschines - at least for every subrole used in
UBELIX and where it makes sense additional ones. This mimics UBELIX' infrastructure. Additionally
it features bash scripts to setup a puppetmaster and to provision puppet on all other machines.
The puppetmaster then enables testing of puppet/hiera code before rolling out to UBELIX.

## Features

In principle it does so by:

* providing differen maschines in the Vagrantfiel according the roles/subrole in UBELIX
* providing scripts to install a puppetmaster and to bootstrap all other nodes with puppet-agent
* providing additional script to fiddle with the puppet code on the puppetmaster
* being a reminder of useful puppet commands. Look into the scripts
* finally being a source of documentation

## Requirements

The following requirements are only of importance  when setting up the development environment on your MacBook of choice.

* UBELIX Puppet environment repository (puppetenv)
* [Vagrant Hosts Plugin](https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts)

To setup the above requirements run the following commands from within the toplevel directory of this project:

    $ git clone https://idos-code.unibe.ch/scm/ubelix/puppetenv.git
    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hosts

## Usage

### Starting machines in general

If requirements above are in place, it's time to fire up the environment:

    $ vagrant up [HOSTNAME]...

Now login to the puppet box:

    $ vagrant ssh HOSTNAME
    $ sudo su -

To see the list of available host run

    $ vagrant status

### Configuring the different scripts

Every script has some variables at the top to configure its behaviour. As of this
writing the defaults will install Puppet-5.3.x and checkout the development branch
of the ubelix control repository.

Keep in mind that environemnts correspond to branches in the puppetenv repository.

All nodes have their environment set in section `[agent]` of the puppet.conf. Only
the puppet agent depends on environment on clients. One important exception to this
rule is the puppetmaster, which must have the environemtn set in section `[main]`.
This is necessary for the puppet cli tool to be able to lookup hiera data from
the correct (same as the agent) environment. For a production puppetmaster (and
hosts) this setting be absent or set to production. In developemnt set it to an
environemnt desired, i.e.:

    $ puppet config set --section agent environment development

Use section main on the puppetmaster.


### Setting up the master host

First clone the pocket-ubelix2 repository and adjust the settings in the scripts. This first
step can be ommited in a development environment locally the repo is already mounted in the
virtual hosts at /vagrant.

    $ git clone https://idos-code.unibe.ch/scm/ubelix/pocket-ubelix2.git
    $ cd pocket-ubelix2

The script 'setup_puppetmaster.sh' interactively installs and configures
a puppetserver and additional things like r10k and eyaml.

    $ /vagrant/setup_puppetmaster (local|ubelix)

Follow the last manual steps outlined by the script after its termination, which
mainly covers setting up priv/pub keys for r10k and eyaml.

Then run `puppet agent -t` for the first time on puppetmaster **(before installing any other host!)**

CAVE: If puppet agent is not run at least once on the puppetmaster, then other hosts cannot connect
because the firewall is closed.

### Setting up the puppetdb host

First clone the pocket-ubelix2 repository and adjust the settings in the scripts. This first
step can be ommited in a development environment locally the repo is already mounted in the
virtual hosts at /vagrant.

    $ git clone https://idos-code.unibe.ch/scm/ubelix/pocket-ubelix2.git
    $ cd pocket-ubelix2

The procedure to provision the puppetdb is as follows:

    $ /vagrant/setup_puppet-agent.sh puppetdb infraserver (local|ubelix)
    $ puppet config set --section main dns_alt_names puppetdb01.ubelix.unibe.ch,puppetdb01,puppetdb
    $ puppet agent -t --waitforcert 20

    # On the puppetmaster:
    $ puppet cert sign HOSTNAME.ubelix.unibe.ch --allow-dns-alt-names


### Setting up other hosts

First clone the pocket-ubelix2 repository and adjust the settings in the scripts. This first
step can be ommited in a development environment locally the repo is already mounted in the
virtual hosts at /vagrant.

    $ git clone https://idos-code.unibe.ch/scm/ubelix/pocket-ubelix2.git
    $ cd pocket-ubelix2

The procedure to provision any other node than the puppetmaster is as follows:

    $ setup_puppet-agent.sh $ROLE $TRIBE (local|ubelix)
    $ puppet agent -t --waitforcert 20

    # On the puppetmaster:
    $ puppet cert sign HOSTNAME.ubelix.unibe.ch

If you don't specify the role and subrole, which are needed to extend
the certificate, you have to set those to values in `/etc/puppetlbas/puppet/csr_attributes.yaml`
by hand **before** running `puppet agent -t`.

## Limitations

All scripts are only tested on the following operating systems:

* CentOS-7.4
